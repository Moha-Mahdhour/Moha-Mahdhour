### Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Al Mahanad, a **B.S. Computer Science** undergraduate at Penn State University. I am interested in **Swift/SwiftUI, Mathematics, and AI**.

🔭 I enjoy learning about AI and its applications, and I am currently learning about **FastAI** Python Library to further expand my knowledge in AI.

🌱 Outside the world of tech I like to go out and have fun with my friends and loved ones. I also enjoy playing vido games 🎮
